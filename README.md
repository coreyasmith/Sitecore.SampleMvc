# Sitecore.SampleMvc

By default Sitecore comes with a sample site that is built on web forms and XSLT. This repository
contains MVC versions of the code for the out-of-the-box Sitecore sample site.

## Getting Started

The code in this repository is explained in detail on 
[my blog](https://www.coreysmith.co/sitecore-beginners-convert-sitecore-sample-site-to-mvc/).

This repository is available as a Sitecore package under 
[Releases](https://github.com/coreyasmith/Sitecore.SampleMvc/releases). When installing the 
package, you will be prompted *Item being installed already exists in database.* Choose the 
*Overwrite* option and click *Apply to all*. Perform a full site publish after installing the 
package.
